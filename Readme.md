A LaTeX template for NSERC-style documents
==========================================

Fill in the info in `application-config.tex` and write your text in
`example.tex` (which you can rename to whatever you like). The rest should
be self-explanatory.

Note that I made up this class for my own personal use; I don't
mind sharing it, but please don't contact me for support.

Use notes
---------

- Don't use the `cite` package. The class already provides `natbib`, which is a
  reimplementation of it.
